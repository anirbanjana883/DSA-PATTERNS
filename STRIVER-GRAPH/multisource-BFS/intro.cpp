BFS :
1. explore all the enighbour of a node before moving to to their respective neighbour
2.typically used to find shortest path in graph or 2D grid 
3.it works lavel by lavel 

MULTISOURCE BFS :
1.first push all the source then do as simillar 
2.startv simultaniously from multiple source 
3.useful when you want to spread out from multiple source /node at once

##### 
why a Multi source BFS is usefull
when you need to compute [ shortest disatance ]/[ minimum cost ]/[ minimum time ]
form multiple starting points to ather points in graph or grid

$$$$$$$$$ 
multi source bfs ensures that all nodes are reached with the minimum 
distance /time from nearest source
