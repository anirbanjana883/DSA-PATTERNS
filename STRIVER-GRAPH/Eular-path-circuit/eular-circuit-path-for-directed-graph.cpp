EULAR CIRCUIT AND PATH FOR DIRECTEED GRAPH ==>

in directed graph there is concept of indegree and outdegree of a node

##**## for EULAR PATH for directed graph==>
specific node can be starting point
condition 1-> source => outdegree[node]-indegree[node]=1
condition 2-> destination => indegree[node]-outdegree[node]=1
condition 3-> all ather node => outdegree[node]==indegree[node]

##**## for EULAR cycle for directed graph==>
any node can be starting point
condition * -> for all  node => outdegree[node]==indegree[node]
