how to approach any question of dp >>

follow the below steps ..

1. try  to represent the indices in terms of index
2. do all possible stuffs on these indeces according to the problem statement 
3. if question says > count all possible ways ->sum up all stuffs 
                    > find minimum -> take minimum of all the stuffs
                    > find maximum -> take maximum of all the stuffs


once you write the recursn then just write loop sismilar to recursn 
and onethings from whwre you start resursn example (function(n-1,4))
int tabulation return the similar thing in tabulation (return dp[n-1][last])

memoizarion =>  start from topmost and move towards base case [top down]
memoizarion =>  start from bast case and move towards extreme case [bottom up]
