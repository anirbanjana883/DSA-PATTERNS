when will you apply recursn ?????????

* when you have to count all possible ways 
* whhen you have to find the best ways 


how to identify a 1D dp problem ??

How to Identify a DP problem?

When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a dynamic programming problem. Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

 * Count the total number of ways
 * Given multiple ways of doing a task, which way will give the minimum or the maximum output.
We can try to apply recursion because we have to try all possible combination . Once we get the recursive solution, we can go ahead to convert it to a dynamic programming one.



 why 1D dp ????????
  basically memoization applied on those veriable which are changing 
  in this case only one variable is changing so we can use 1D dp <3 <3
